For example: - Step 1: Pick up block B and place it on the table. - Step 2: Pick up block A and place it on block B. - Step 3: Pick up block D and place it on the table. - Step 4: Pick up block C and place it on block D. 5. **Verify the plan**: Check that the robotic arm is empty at the beginning and end of the operation and that the blocks are in the desired positions. **Part b) Family Tree Representation** To create a family tree and perform reasoning operations, follow these steps: 1. **Define the family relationships**: Identify the members of your family and their relationships (e.g., father, mother, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother). 2. **Represent the relationships using logical predicates**: Use predicates like father(X, Y), mother(X, Y), brother(X, Y), sister(X, Y), grandfather(X, Y), and grandmother(X, Y) to represent the relationships. 3. **Create a knowledge base**: Compile a list of all the relationships, such as: - father(A, B) - mother(C, B) - father(D, A) - mother(E, A) 4. **Perform reasoning operations**: Use the knowledge base to answer questions and validate relationships, such as: - Is D the grandfather of B? (Yes, because father(D, A) and father(A, B)) - Is E the grandmother of B? (Yes, because mother(E, A) and father(A, B)) 5. **Verify the relationships**: Check the consistency of the knowledge base and ensure that the relationships are correctly represented. **Final Answer Format**: Provide a clear and concise final answer, including: - The step-by-step plan for the block world problem. - The family tree representation using logical predicates. - Examples of reasoning operations performed on the family tree.

His expression is a mix of courage and defiance, showcasing his readiness to face whatever challenges come his way. ## Environment & Lighting The setting is a dark and foreboding alleyway in Hell's Kitchen, with tall buildings looming in the background, casting long and ominous shadows. The dramatic, high-contrast lighting accentuates the gritty atmosphere, with deep shadows that seem to pulse with the city's criminal energy. The air is thick with tension, and the sense of danger is palpable, as if the Kingpin's presence is felt, even if not seen. ## Style & Composition The scene is rendered in a photorealistic style, with meticulous attention to detail, bringing the dark and gritty world of Hell's Kitchen to life. The composition is a close-up shot, with a shallow depth of field, drawing the viewer's attention to Howard's determined expression, while the background blur adds to the sense of intimacy and immediacy. The 1:1 aspect ratio creates a sense of claustrophobia, emphasizing the feeling of being trapped in the narrow alleyway. ## Additional Artistic Notes The incorporation of elements from the Born Again storyline, such as the Kingpin's presence, adds a layer of complexity to the scene, hinting at the larger narrative that unfolds in the shadows of Hell's Kitchen. The contrast between Howard's vibrant, cartoon-like appearance and the dark, gritty environment creates a visually striking juxtaposition, highlighting the absurdity and humor that defines the character, even in the face of danger.

129,"We need an Expense Tracker that helps employees record work-related spending in one simple place. Today, expenses are often shared over email or managed in spreadsheets, which can lead to missing details, delayed approvals, and confusion about payment status. The goal of this tool is to make it easy to capture expenses, submit them for approval, and ensure reimbursements happen on time with proper records.

The Expense Tracker will be used by three main groups of people: employees, managers, and the Finance team. Employees will use it to enter their expenses and submit reimbursement claims. Managers will use it to review and either approve or reject claims from their team. Finance will use it to verify approved claims, process reimbursements, and maintain reporting records for the company.

The system should allow an employee to add an expense with basic details such as the date, expense category (for example, travel, food, stay, or other), the amount, and a short note explaining what it was for. The employee should also be able to attach a receipt (such as a photo or PDF) so the expense can be verified. Employees should be able to save expenses as drafts while they are still collecting bills, and later group them into a single claim for submission.

Once submitted, the claim should move through a simple approval flow. The employee should be able to see the status clearly, such as Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, or Paid, so they always know where things stand. Managers should be able to review the submitted claim, check the details and attachments, and then approve or reject it. If a claim is rejected, the manager should be able to add a short comment explaining why, and the employee should be able to update the claim and submit it again.

After a claim is approved by the manager, the Finance team should be able to access it for reimbursement processing. Finance should be able to mark the claim as Paid once the reimbursement is completed. The system should also support basic reporting so Finance and management can see totals by employee, by expense type, and by month for tracking and auditing purposes.

Some basic rules should apply to keep data clean and consistent. Each expense should require a date, category, and a valid amount, and the amount should always be a positive number in the company’s chosen currency. Receipts should be mandatory for expenses above a defined limit (for example, 

500

500 INR), and only managers should be allowed to approve or reject claims. Similarly, only Finance should be allowed to mark claims as Paid to prevent misuse or incorrect status updates.

Optional features that can be added later include making the tool mobile-friendly for quick bill uploads, sending reminders for approvals that are pending for too long, and sending notifications to employees when their claim is approved, rejected, or paid.","You are a software development expert tasked with designing an Expense Tracker system.

155,"It's a plug-in-and-play, wall-mounted unit (designed like a smart smoke detector for energy) that passively detects and reports appliance-level waste. No daily input needed—it runs 24/7, uses onboard AI for subtle automations and feedback, and aims for 20-30% savings on electricity bills. Targeted at apartments/homes up to 1000 sq ft (one unit covers ~800-1000 sq ft effectively). tackling invisible electricity waste in homes . this is one idea. How It Works (Detection & Interpretation)
The hub uses a combo of non-contact sensors to pick up signals within ~15-30 feet (best in same room, through thin walls):

Electromagnetic Antenna — Sniffs AC field fluctuations/harmonics (catches phantom draws, motor starts, switching noise).
Passive Infrared (PIR) Array — Detects heat from appliances (e.g., overheating components or running motors).
Acoustic Microphone — Hears hums, fans, pumps, clicks (e.g., fridge compressor or washer cycles).
Temp/Humidity + Optional Light Sensor — Contextualizes data (e.g., ignores heat from sun, spots lights left on in empty rooms).

Onboard AI (edge chip) builds a baseline of your room's normal patterns over the first week, then flags anomalies:

Raw signals → feature extraction (e.g., power signature spikes).
Comparison to learned models → identifies appliance/waste type.
Reports via app (real-time graphs, savings estimates, tips).

Example: Charger left plugged in → EM sniffer catches low ""vampire"" draw → AI knows it's not active use → nudge to unplug → potential 30% overall reduction from fixing multiple leaks.
Components & Build

Size/Design: Compact (thick paperback book size), fire-resistant plastic case, subtle LED.
Inside:
ARM processor + edge AI chip (local processing).
Sensors (as above).
Wi-Fi + BLE for app/hub sync.
Low-power draw (<1W itself) + backup battery.
Standard wall plug cord.

Mount: Magnetic/adhesive—no tools.

Real-Life Benefits & Practicality

Pays for itself in 6-12 months via savings.
Tested prototypes show 15-30% drops (e.g., catching standby on consoles, inefficient appliance runs).
Best for gadget-heavy rooms (kitchen, bedroom, office).
Limitations: Range-focused per room; walls block stronger signals—so multiple units for whole-home.installing turbines in pipelines to generate electricity and charge it through usb .

This assessment is worth 20% of your final mark in this module.
A core part of making sound, evidence-based decisions is being able to conceptualise and plan
how you will go about conducting research to gather, assess, and analyse relevant information.
This assessment task is designed to provide you with the opportunity to develop and pitch your
research plan in response to the module’s overall project brief for this term as presented in a
Request for Proposals (RFP) disseminated by your module leader.
You will be expected to create a PowerPoint deck that will underpin a five-minute presentation of
your RFP response. This should include all elements of an RFP identified in Chapter 2 of the
Coombs textbook, including your own original plan for the proposed methods/research design.
While the deck will include all required elements in an RFP response, your presentation will focus
on your independent thinking on three sections:
1. Relevant background
2. Proposed methods
3. Proposed timing
NOTE: In upcoming weeks, you will be assigned to a team that will finalise and execute a research
project to meet the client’s business objective and address the research questions. Your collective
research pitches will be used as the foundation for designing the research plan you will execute
over the remainder of the term.

Do it for Gen-z audience 

A photorealistic 3D animated reveal of the 'CQS' barbecue logo. The scene begins in total darkness with the sound of sizzling fat and crackling wood.

First, embers spark, illuminating the crossed spatula and barbecue fork in the background. They are not flat black, but rendered as heavy, seasoned cast iron with realistic metallic textures and slight scratches, reflecting the growing heat. Smoke curls around them.

Next, the bottom grill grate heats up, glowing dull red at the edges. The letters 'CQS' begin to ignite from the center outwards. The bottom half of the letters forms from cooling, blackened charcoal, while the top half and the swoosh line glow intensely like molten lava or orange-hot coals, with real heat distortion shimmering the air around them.

Finally, the black grill hood slams down over the text with a heavy metallic thud. As it lands, a burst of realistic, volumetric orange and yellow fire erupts from the top opening. The fire casts dynamic, flickering warm light onto the metallic tools and the glowing text below. The final shot holds steady on the burning, smoking logo with embers drifting upwards in a cinematic, high-contrast environment.


Detailed Logo Description:
The logo is a dynamic, circular emblem focused on the theme of barbecue and grilling. It is composed of several layered elements:

Central Text: The focal point is the stylized acronym ""CQS"" in a bold, modern, sans-serif font. The letters feature a striking color gradient split by a swooshing curved line running diagonally upward from left to right.

Top Half: The upper section of the letters and the swoosh line are a vibrant fiery gradient, transitioning from deep orange to bright yellow.

Bottom Half: The lower section of the letters below the swoosh is solid black.

The Grill Emblem: The text rests over a circular graphic representing a barbecue grill.

Top Lid: Above the text is a solid black silhouette of a rounded grill lid or hood.

Bottom Grate: Below the text is the lower half of the circle, depicted as a black grill grate with vertical bars.

The Flame: Erupting from the center top of the black grill lid is a stylized flame. It matches the orange-to-yellow gradient of the text, adding a sense of heat and energy.

Crossed Tools: Behind the central circular grill emblem, two barbecue tools are crossed in an ""X"" formation. They are rendered as solid black silhouettes.

Left Tool: A spatula, angled from top-left to bottom-right.

Right Tool: A two-pronged barbecue fork, angled from top-right to bottom-left.

Overall Composition: The entire design is balanced and contained roughly within a circular shape, using a color palette strictly limited to black, orange, and yellow on a white background.","Create a photorealistic 3D animated reveal of the 'CQS' barbecue logo, specifically designed for a Gen-z audience.

Simultaneously, ignite the 'CQS' letters from the center outwards. The bottom half of the letters should form from cooling, blackened charcoal, while the top half and the swoosh line should glow intensely like molten lava or orange-hot coals, with real heat distortion shimmering the air around them. 4. **Final Reveal**: Have the black grill hood slam down over the text with a heavy metallic thud, followed by a burst of realistic, volumetric orange and yellow fire erupting from the top opening. This fire should cast dynamic, flickering warm light onto the metallic tools and the glowing text below. 5. **Conclusion**: Hold the final shot steady on the burning, smoking logo with embers drifting upwards, creating a cinematic, high-contrast environment that engages the viewer. **Logo Specifications**: - The logo is a circular emblem with a bold, modern, sans-serif 'CQS' acronym. - The letters feature a striking color gradient split by a swooshing curved line, with the top half and swoosh line in a vibrant fiery gradient (deep orange to bright yellow) and the bottom half in solid black. - The logo includes a circular graphic representing a barbecue grill, with a solid black silhouette of a rounded grill lid above the text and a black grill grate with vertical bars below. - A stylized flame erupts from the center top of the black grill lid, matching the orange-to-yellow gradient of the text. - Two barbecue tools (a spatula and a fork) are crossed in an ""X"" formation behind the central circular grill emblem, rendered as solid black silhouettes. **Output Requirements**: Deliver a high-quality, 3D animated video that meets the specified requirements, ensuring clarity, specificity, and engagement for a Gen-z audience.

ONLY improve, polish, and FIX the current landing page files already in the project:
(index.html, style.css, script.js, privacy.html, terms.html, disclaimer.html).

Apply the following fixes and upgrades WITHOUT removing any major structure. Keep everything intact, only improve it.

────────────────────────────────────────
LOGO + HERO IMAGE (IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────────────
1. Replace the current hero/attorney image with this exact Cloudinary image:
   https://res.cloudinary.com/ddnkxcc8v/image/upload/v1692648039/ywdumuluvb7jc6melawi.webp

2. Replace the text-only logo with an actual small logo image placed at /assets/logo.png.
   Use the same Cloudinary image as placeholder or generate a clean “CC” mark in dark navy + white.

Make sure both images scale perfectly on mobile & desktop.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 1: CTA DARK BAND SECTION (THE ONE MARKED IN RED)
────────────────────────────────────────
The dark navy CTA block above the footer currently looks:
• Too empty  
• Misaligned  
• Wrong vertical spacing on desktop & mobile  
• Bad button placement on mobile  
• Overlaps footer / looks broken  

Fix it as follows:

A) Desktop layout:
   - Make dark section height auto with generous padding: 90px top & bottom.
   - Left side: paragraph text (max-width: 650px).
   - Right side: “Start Now” button aligned vertically center.
   - Make button gold with subtle shadow and hover lift.
   - Add a subtle fade-up animation when this section scrolls into view.

B) Mobile layout:
   - Stack text first.
   - Button centered under the text with 28px margin.
   - Fix spacing so footer NEVER overlaps.
   - Add margin-bottom: 40px before footer.

C) Ensure NO overflow-x on mobile.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 2: FOOTER (THE WHITE SECTION)
────────────────────────────────────────
Problems:
• The footer is too close to the CTA section  
• Layout breaks on mobile  
• Links bunch together  

Fix:

- Add 50px padding top/bottom desktop, 26px mobile.
- Footer columns stack cleanly on mobile: column 1 then 2 then 3.
- Add 1px soft border-top.
- Ensure footer background stays white, never mixing with dark CTA band.
- Fix spacing so NOTHING overlaps or touches screen edges.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 3: NAVBAR MOBILE TOGGLE MENU
────────────────────────────────────────
Add a mobile hamburger menu:

- On screens below 830px:
  • Hide nav links
  • Show hamburger icon (three bars)
  • Clicking opens slide-down menu with:
    Case Review | Benefits | Who Qualifies | Testimonials | CTA button
  • Animations: fade + slide-down
  • Add aria attributes for accessibility
  • Close menu when clicking outside

Make it polished and clean like a real law-firm site.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 4: TESTIMONIAL SECTION UPGRADE (IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────────────
Current testimonials look too few and static.

Replace with:
- **10–12 client testimonials**
- Each testimonial uses an actual real-looking stock image placeholder:
  /assets/testimonials/img1.jpg
  ...
  /assets/testimonials/img12.jpg
- Clean card style, shadows, trust-first layout
- Add a horizontal slider/carousel:
  • Autoplay every 4 seconds
  • Pause on hover
  • Swipe support on mobile
  • Dots navigation under slider

Ensure mobile shows 1 card per slide, desktop shows 3.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 5: GENERAL POLISH + ANIMATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────
Add subtle real-website animations:

- Fade-up on all main sections using IntersectionObserver.
- Subtle hero image parallax (5–10px translateY).
- Button hover lift effect (2–4px).
- Remove ANY exaggerated animations.

NO cartoon effects, NO neon, NO emojis.

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 6: MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────
Fix all mobile issues:

- No overlapping of sections
- No crushed spacing
- Proper padding in forms
- Testimonials slider fully responsive
- CTA band perfectly stacked
- Navbar toggle working smoothly
- Remove horizontal scroll completely

────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 7: DO NOT REMOVE ANYTHING IMPORTANT
────────────────────────────────────────
Do NOT:
• Remove sections  
• Remove form  
• Remove hero  
• Remove benefits  
• Remove attorney block  
• Remove disclaimers  
• Overwrite entire files with a new structure  

ONLY polish, enhance, fix spacing, add responsiveness, and replace the required images.

────────────────────────────────────────

Reference Write Up 1: PaySimple - Reference Write Up.Small business owners are certainly the backbone of the economy. The easier it is to interact and transact with a small business owner, both the community and the business have an easier time to move forward. PaySimple aims to make life easier for this valuable group of people. 

As an industry-leading provider of payment management solutions, PaySimple makes billing and collection processes effortlessly simple by enabling businesses to bill, collect and deposit all of their payments automatically. The company's customized, secure ASP solution includes recurring billing, electronic check processing, and direct debit and credit card processing at some of the lowest rates available.

A key initiative they have been working on and continue to pursue is the idea of making the business side of running a small business as simple and as easy as possible. They are doing this by removing the friction small businesses experience today in the process of invoicing, collecting payments for services rendered, and reconciling their books.

With PaySimple's complete integrated solution, processing all types of electronic payments becomes straightforward. With any other payment processor, business owners are equipped with only a payment engine through which they control and maintain each and every facet, such as account reconciliation, merchant statements, bank and merchant communications, and so on of their system. On the other hand, PaySimple provides users with the complete front and back-end processing solution needed to streamline accounts receivables and integrate seamlessly with business management software. 

""Small businesses that are using an integrated payments feature as part of their business are seeing dramatic increases in time saved throughout their week, reductions in deferred appointments or incomplete payments, and getting paid faster and infusing that money into growing their business,"" remarks CEO David Sharp.

One of the notable features of PaySimple is its security measures. The platform is outfitted with the most powerful security and encryption tools currently available. The processing website is secured and encrypted using a 1024-bit Thawte Digital Certificate The Payment Gateway uses a 1024-bit Verisign Digital Certificate but accommodates the majority of browsers at 128-bit encryption.

Integrating management software with PaySimple is not a difficult task either. PaySimple is compatible with most business management software, and the company provides an easy import/export function that can map custom fields for seamless integration.

The Recurring Bill or AutoPay is a powerful solution offered by PaySimple. For businesses, recurring billing allows procurement of money on time, every time. As a result, there is a normalization of cash flow which significantly impacts how the business is managed. It is also a way to eliminate the time and money associated with printing and mailing paper invoices. The entire accounts receivable process can be fully automated, leaving the business owners with time for other pursuits. As a customer, Recurring Bill automatically pays bills without the hassle of receiving invoices, mailing checks, or finding the time to deliver payments in person. It is desirable for regular charges of the same amount. There is no better way to describe it than a win-win scenario.

PaySimple exists with the singular purpose of simplifying and empowering other people's lives. The company's drive to make life easier for the small businesses that serve others daily has led to a Silver Stevie® Award in the Sales & Customer Service category in the 15th annual Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service. This award is a much-needed appreciation for a company that puts customer experience as the top priority. 

Description: PaySimple is a payment management solutions provider that seeks to provide secure ASP solutions at some of the lowest rates in the market to cater to small business owners' needs.

**PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI (HABIT TRACKER WEBSITE):**

You are Replit AI inside a **new blank Replit project**.
Create a fully working, responsive **Habit Tracker website** using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** only.
Do **not** use React, frameworks, or external libraries.

---

### 🔧 Project Setup

Create these files:

* `index.html`
* `style.css`
* `script.js`

Requirements:

* `index.html` must correctly link `style.css` and `script.js`.
* The app must run using Replit’s default web server (pressing ""Run"" should open the habit tracker in the browser).

---

### 🧱 Overall App Description

Build a **single-page Habit Tracker web app** that lets a user:

* Add habits
* Mark habits done for today
* Track streaks and best streaks
* View simple history per habit
* See daily progress
* Save everything in `localStorage`
* Enjoy a clean, modern, mobile-friendly UI

---

### 🎨 Layout & UI Design

* Modern, clean, minimal design.

* **Mobile-first, responsive** layout.

* Use CSS Flexbox or Grid; no CSS frameworks.

* Page structure:

  * A fixed or sticky **header** containing:

    * App title: `My Habit Tracker`
    * Today’s date (set dynamically with JavaScript).
    * A **light/dark mode toggle** button.
  * Below header, main content with sections:

    1. A small **motivational message area** (text updates depending on progress).
    2. A **Daily Progress** overview section:

       * Text like: `Today: X / Y habits completed`
       * A simple progress bar showing completion percentage.
    3. An **""Add New Habit""** form.
    4. A **""Today’s Habits""** checklist.
    5. An **""All Habits""** section with streak info, search, sorting, and filters.

* Use **cards** or panels for each habit in the ""All Habits"" section.

* Add subtle **CSS transitions/animations** for:

  * Adding a habit
  * Deleting a habit
  * Updating progress bar

---

### 📝 Add & Manage Habits

Create an **""Add New Habit""** form with:

* Inputs:

  * Habit Name (required text input)
  * Category (select: `Health`, `Study`, `Work`, `Personal`, `Other`)
  * Frequency (select: `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Custom` — just store this; no complex scheduling logic needed)
* On submit:

  * Validate that Habit Name is not empty.
  * Create a new habit object with a unique id.
  * Save the habit to `localStorage`.
  * Re-render the UI.
  * Clear the form.

Each habit should store at least:

* `id`
* `name`
* `category`
* `frequency`
* `createdAt` (date string)
* `currentStreak`
* `bestStreak`

In the **""All Habits""** section, each habit card should show:

* Habit name
* Category
* Frequency
* `Current streak: X days`
* `Best streak: Y days`
* Buttons:

  * **Edit**
  * **Delete**
  * **View History**

Implement:

* **Edit**:

  * Clicking Edit loads that habit’s data into the ""Add New Habit"" form.
  * Change the form into ""Edit mode"" (e.g., button text: ""Update Habit"").
  * Saving updates the habit in `localStorage` and UI.

* **Delete**:

  * Clicking Delete shows a **confirmation dialog** (custom modal or `confirm()`):

    * Example: `""Are you sure you want to delete this habit?""`
  * If confirmed:

    * Remove the habit and its related completion data from `localStorage`.
    * Update UI.

---

### ✅ Today’s Habits Checklist

Create a **""Today’s Habits""** section:

* For the current date (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`), display each habit with a checkbox:

  * `[ ] Habit Name (Category)`

* When the user checks a habit:

  * Mark that habit as **done for today**.
  * Save completion status in `localStorage`.
  * Recalculate streak for that habit.
  * Update daily progress and motivational message.

* When user unchecks a habit:

  * Update completion data in `localStorage`.
  * Recalculate streaks and progress accordingly.

Date format:

* Use a consistent format like `YYYY-MM-DD` as the key for each day’s completion.

Daily behavior:

* When the date changes (new day), the UI should:

  * Show all habits as unchecked initially.
  * Preserve historical data and streaks.
  * Progress resets for the new day (0 completed).

---

### 🔥 Streaks & Progress Logic

For each habit:

* Maintain a **current streak** (consecutive days done up to today).
* Maintain a **best streak** (maximum historical streak).

Implement logic to:

* Recalculate streaks based on historical completion data stored in `localStorage`.
* On page load:

  * Load all completion history.
  * Calculate current streak and best streak for each habit.
  * Update the habit cards.

Daily Progress:

* At top in the progress section:

  * Show `Today: X / Y habits completed`
  * Draw a progress bar whose width represents the completion percentage (`X/Y * 100`).

---

### 📅 History / Analytics per Habit

When the user clicks **""View History""** on a habit:

* Open a simple **modal** (overlay) or **side panel** that shows:

  * Habit name at top.
  * A list of dates (at least last 7–30 days) with status:

    * Example:

      * `2025-11-20 – Done`
      * `2025-11-21 – Not done`
      * `2025-11-22 – Done`
  * The modal should have:

    * A close button (e.g., `X`).
    * Scrollable history area.

* Read all status for that habit from `localStorage`.

---

### 💾 Data Persistence (localStorage)

Use `localStorage` to persist:

* The list of habits (array of habit objects).
* Completion statuses:

  * You can structure it like:

    * `completions[habitId][dateString] = true/false`
* Streak values:

  * Either store them or recalculate them on load from history.

On page load:

1. Read everything from `localStorage`.
2. Render:

   * Habits list
   * Today’s checklist
   * Streaks
   * Progress bar
   * Motivational message

Whenever anything changes (add/edit/delete habit, check/uncheck for today, change theme, etc.):

* Update both the UI and `localStorage`.

---

### 🎛️ Search, Sorting, and Filtering

In the **""All Habits""** section, add:

* A **search input** to filter habits by name in real-time.
* A **category filter** dropdown (e.g., All, Health, Study, Work, etc.).
* A **sort dropdown** with options:

  * Name (A–Z)
  * Category
  * Highest current streak
  * Highest best streak

As the user types or changes filters/sort:

* Update the rendered list of habits.

---

### 🌗 Light / Dark Mode

* Add a **light/dark mode toggle** in the header.
* Implement two CSS themes:

  * Light: bright background, dark text.
  * Dark: dark background, light text.
* Save the selected theme in `localStorage`.
* On page load:

  * Apply the last selected theme.

---

### 💬 Motivational Messages & Celebration

* Show a motivational text somewhere near the top, for example:

  * If **no habits completed**: `""Let's start small. Do one thing today 💪""`
  * If **some but not all completed**: `""Nice progress! Keep going 🚀""`
  * If **all habits completed for today**:

    * `""Amazing! All habits completed today 🎉""`

* When **all habits for today are completed**:

  * Trigger a **short celebration effect**, such as:

    * A small CSS-based confetti animation OR
    * A simple expanding/ fading success banner.
  * Optionally play a short success sound if easy, with an option to mute sounds.

---

### 🚀 Onboarding & Help

* On first visit, show a simple **onboarding modal** explaining:

  * How to add a habit.
  * How to mark habits as done.
  * That streaks and history are tracked automatically.
* Include a ""Got it"" button.
* Store onboarding completion in `localStorage` so it doesn’t appear again automatically (but can be reopened from a small ""Help"" or ""?"" button).

---

### 📤 Export / Import Data (Backup)

* Add an **""Export Data""** button:

  * Exports all habit data and completion history as a downloadable JSON file.
* Add an **""Import Data""** button:

  * Allows the user to select a JSON file (in the same format).
  * After confirming, load it into the app:

    * Merge or replace existing data (simpler: replace entirely).
    * Save to `localStorage`.
    * Re-render UI.

Handle edge cases:

* Invalid JSON format -> show a user-friendly error message.
* Confirm before overwriting existing data.

---

### 🧠 Code Organization & Quality

In `script.js`:

* Organize code into clear sections and functions, such as:

  * `loadDataFromLocalStorage()`
  * `saveDataToLocalStorage()`
  * `renderHabitsList()`
  * `renderTodayChecklist()`
  * `updateStreaks()`
  * `updateDailyProgress()`
  * `openHistoryModal(habitId)`
  * `applyTheme()`
  * `showOnboarding()`
* Add **comments** explaining:

  * Data structures
  * How streaks are calculated
  * How localStorage is used
  * How the UI rendering works
* Avoid unnecessary global variables; use objects/modules where reasonable.

In `index.html`:

* Use semantic HTML where possible (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
* Give meaningful `id` and `class` names for elements that JavaScript will manipulate.

In `style.css`:

* Define base styles and variables for colors for easy theme switching.
* Add responsive rules so the layout works nicely on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

---

### ✅ Final Result

Deliver a **fully functional Habit Tracker website** with:

* Add / edit / delete habits
* Today’s checklist
* Streak and best streak tracking
* History modal per habit
* Daily progress summary and progress bar
* Motivational messages and celebration when all done

694,"## 조경 실무 교육 첫시간 강의 전략 (수정본 - 시공 관리 중점)

### 핵심 방향성

첫 시간은 **설명 중심의 강의**로 진행되며, 학생들이 조경 시공 관리의 현장 실무를 이해하고 ""이 강좌가 내 취업과 커리어에 직결된다""는 동기를 형성하도록 설계해야 합니다.

***

## **1단계: 강력한 오프닝 - 설계 vs 시공의 갭 제시 (12-15분)**

**목표**: 첫 10분 안에 ""시공 관리자는 무엇을 하는가""에 대한 명확한 답변 제시

**구성:**

- **시각적 임팩트: 설계 의도 vs 실제 현장 문제들**
  - 같은 도면이 아닌, **설계자의 이상적인 의도와 현장의 현실적 문제**를 대조
  - 구체적 사례들:[1][2][3]
    - **이미지 개선 설계변경**: 설계에는 가이즈까향나무로 예정했으나, 현장에서 시공하려니 품절, 또는 주변 환경과 맞지 않아 섬잣나무로 변경 → 시공 관리자가 판단하고 지시
    - **설계 내역 불일치**: 설계도면과 적산 내역이 맞지 않음 (예: 도면에는 포장 100mm인데 내역서는 80mm) → 현장에서 누가 결정하는가?
    - **토심 부족 문제**: 인공지반 위 대형수목 식재 설계 → 실제 토심이 기준 미달 → 식재할 수 없는 상황[4]
    - **계절 고려 부족**: 설계와 준공일정이 동·하절기에 겹침 → 활착률 극히 낮음 → 하자 발생[3]

  - 시각화: 계획도 1장 옆에 ""현장에서 발생한 5가지 문제"" 사진 배열
  - 각 문제마다 ""이 상황에서 누가 결정을 내리는가?""라는 질문 제시

- **현장 문제 사례 (시공 관리자의 입장에서)**[2][3]
  - ""도면에는 이렇게 되어 있는데, 현장에 가보니...""
    - 예1: 기존 지중 배관이 설계 경로와 충돌 → 포장 경로 변경 필요 → 면적 변경 → 공사비 변경
    - 예2: 설계에는 특정 수종으로 명시했으나, 시공 시기에 그 수종을 구할 수 없음 → 대체 수종 선정, 미관상 동등한 효과 확인, 비용 재산출
    - 예3: 현장 조사 미비로 설계한 구간이 실제로는 배수가 불가능한 구조 → 배수 시설 추가 설계 필요[3]
    - 예4: 조경공사가 인테리어 공사와 겹쳐서 일정이 밀림 → 최악의 시기인 여름에 식재 시공 → 나무가 고사할 위험
  
  - 이 모든 상황에서 **시공 관리자의 판단과 현장 지시**가 최종 결과를 결정한다는 점 강조[5][3]

- **산업 현실 제시**:
  - 조경 산업의 가장 큰 문제: 최저가 입찰로 인한 부실공사, 숙련공 부족[6]
  - 하지만 **뛰어난 시공 관리자는 이 악조건 속에서도 품질을 지켜낼 수 있는 사람**
  - 현장에서는 설계도 중요하지만, **""현장을 아는 시공 관리자""가 더 중요한 역할 수행**

***

## **2단계: 시공 관리자의 역할 정의 - 업무 전체 구조 제시 (10-12분)**

**목표**: 학생들에게 ""시공 관리자는 어떤 일을 하는 사람인가""에 대한 명확한 이해 제공

**구성:**

- **시공 관리자의 핵심 3가지 책임** (비유를 통한 설명)
  - 1) **도면 해석자**: ""건축사의 설계도를 현장 근로자들이 이해할 수 있도록 해석해주는 사람""
  - 2) **품질 검증자**: ""설계 의도대로 시공되고 있는지, 품질 기준을 충족하는지 확인하는 사람""
  - 3) **문제 해결자**: ""현장에서 발생하는 예상 밖의 상황들(날씨, 자재 부족, 설계 변경, 타공종 연쇄 변경)을 해결하는 사람""[2][3]

- **시공 관리자의 업무 흐름** (타임라인으로 표현)
  - **시공 전**: 도면 검토, 공사 계획 수립, 자재 발주 확인, 시공 불가능한 부분 선별
  - **시공 중**: 일일 현장 점검, 품질 검사, 현장 지시서 작성, 설계 변경 검토 및 승인 요청
  - **준공 후**: 최종 검수, 준공서류 작성, 하자 보수 지도, 입주자 민원 대응[5][3]

- **강사의 경험담** (2-3분):
  - 자신이 경험한 시공 사례: ""설계 변경 한 건을 놓쳐서 공사비가 5,000만 원 증가했던 순간""
  - ""현장 판단이 늦어서 여름에 식재하게 되고, 결국 나무 고사로 하자 소송까지 간 사례""[7][3]
  - ""대체 수종 선정으로 미관을 지키면서도 공사비를 절감한 성공 사례""
  - 이러한 이야기를 통해 시공 관리의 **중요성과 긴장감**, 그리고 **보람** 전달

***

## **3단계: 시공 관리의 3가지 핵심 역량 설명 (50-55분)**

**목표**: 설명 중심이지만 현장 사례를 통해 각 역량의 중요성 내재화

**섹션 A: 도면 분석 및 현장 적용 능력 (18분)**

- **도면의 계층 구조**:
  - 마스터플랜(전체 레이아웃) → 기본설계도(구간별 배치) → 상세도(시공 상세)
  - 각 도면이 현장에서 어떻게 해석되는지 구체적으로 설명

- **""도면을 읽는 시공 관리자의 눈""**:
  - 단순히 도면을 보는 것이 아니라, ""**설계자가 간과한 현실적 제약을 찾아내기**""
  - 포장 상세도 예시: 포장 단면도 1장으로 현장의 5개 구간(경사진 곳, 평탄한 곳, 기존 배관 주변, 배수구 주변 등)에 적용되는 방식 분석
  - **""이 구간에서는 이 상세대로 시공할 수 있는가?""라는 질문을 매번 던져야 함**

- **현장에서 발견되는 설계 문제들**[1][3]
  - 도면에는 ""50cm 포장""이라 적혀 있으나, 실제 기초층·쿠션층·포장층의 각각 두께가 명확하지 않음
  - 식재 상세도: 토심 기준이 인공지반에 적용 불가능한 깊이로 지정됨
  - ""현장 조사가 제대로 되지 않았다는 신호""를 도면에서 읽어내는 능력
  - 설계자에게 피드백하고, 현장의 현실에 맞게 조정하는 과정

- **실제 현장 사례**:
  - 사례1: 인공지반에 대형수목 식재 설계 → 토심 확보 불가능 → 시공 관리자가 구조엔지니어와 협의하여 방근시트 추가 설계
  - 사례2: 포장 기초가 설계된 깊이보다 얕음 → 시공 불가능 판단 → 발주처와 협의하여 설계 변경
  - ""이 모든 것을 도면에서 읽고, 현장에서 검증하고, 문제를 해결하는 것이 시공 관리자의 역할""

**섹션 B: 품질 관리 및 설계 변경 대응 능력 (17분)**

- **품질 기준의 이해**:[7][3]
  - 건축법 기준, 한국 조경 기준, 조경공사 표준시방서, 발주처의 특별 요구사항
  - **""설계도는 '이상적인 그림'인데, 현장의 '현실'과 항상 일치하지 않는다""**

- **설계 변경의 현실**:[2][3]
  - 조경 설계 변경의 주요 원인들:
    - 이미지 개선 (25%): 미관상 더 좋은 대안 발견 시
    - 설계 내역 불일치 (23.5%): 도면과 적산이 맞지 않음
    - 이용자 미고려 (18.3%): 입주자 민원, 실사용 불편
    - 현장조사 미비 (9.7%): 지중 매설물, 기존 구조물 미발견
    - 시공성 고려 (7.7%): 도면대로 시공 불가능
    - 유지관리 (7.2%): 나중 관리를 고려한 변경
    - 타공종 영향 (6.7%): 건축, 토목 변경으로 인한 연쇄 변경[3][2]

  - **""당신이 이 7가지 상황을 모두 경험할 것입니다""**

- **일일 현장 점검의 중요성**:
  - 포장 공사 때 기초 콘크리트 강도 확인 프로세스
  - 식재 때 흙의 배합, 배수, 비료 확인
  - 우천으로 인한 배수 상태 모니터링
  - 각 항목별 현장 점검 체크리스트 제시 (강사가 실제로 사용하는 서식 예시)

- **현장 지시서 작성의 중요성**:[5][3]
  - 문제 발견 → 사진 촬영 → 위치 명확화 → 지시서 작성 → 시공사 조치 → 재점검 → 완료 보고
  - ""**서면으로 남겨야만 나중에 책임을 물을 수 있다""는 현실적 조언
  - 지시서 사례 1-2개 (민감한 정보 제거)

- **설계 변경서 작성 및 승인 프로세스**:[2][3]
  - 현장에서 ""변경이 필요하다""고 발견 → 변경 사유 작성 → 설계사, 감리사, 발주처 승인 → 공사비/공기 조정
  - ""이 프로세스를 빠르고 정확하게 처리해야 공사 지연을 막을 수 있음""

- **하자 소송과 시공 관리의 연결고리**:[7]
  - 법원은 시공 관리자가 ""성실하게 점검하고 문서로 남겼는가""를 본다
  - ""초기 단계에서 치밀한 기록이 나중의 법적 문제를 예방한다""

**섹션 C: 원가 관리 및 일정 조정 능력 (15-20분)**

- **공사 원가의 구조**:
  - 설계 도서에서 나온 수량 → 적산(원가 계산) → 공사 계약금액
  - ""시공 관리자가 수량을 정확히 파악하지 못하면, 공사비 초과로 이어진다""[3][2]

- **수량 산출 및 설계 변경 시 재산출**:
  - 포장 공사: 면적 × 두께 → m³ 단위로 물량 계산
  - 식재 공사: 식재 간격 × 단가 등
  - **현장에서 설계와 다른 부분이 발생했을 때, 수량을 다시 산출하고 공사비 영향 계산**

- **타공종 변경으로 인한 설계 변경**:[3]
  - 조경공사는 건설 공정의 **마지막 단계**
  - 건축, 토목 공사가 끝나고 나서 조경을 시작하는데, 이때 예상 밖의 상황 발생
  - 예) 지하주차장 슬라브 구조 변경 → 옥상 조경 식재 깊이 불가능 → 포장 구조 변경 → 수량 재산출
  - ""이런 상황에서 신속하게 대응하는 시공 관리자의 가치가 발휘됨""

- **공기 관리와 계절 선택**:[3]
  - 식재 공사는 ""활착률이 높은 시기""(봄, 가을)가 중요
  - 하지만 준공 일정이 정해져 있으면 여름·겨울에 식재 → 고사 가능성 증가
  - **시공 관리자가 준공 일정과 식재 시기를 조율하여 품질 보장**

- **원가와 품질의 균형**:
  - 시공사 입장: 원가 절감 압박
  - 발주처 입장: 품질 유지 요구
  - 시공 관리자 입장: ""이 균형을 맞추는 것""이 핵심 역량

The day before the viva, the teacher notified us about the schedule, but I was unable to study due to a high fever. Unfortunately, I forgot about the viva until a friend reminded me just half an hour before it was supposed to take place. **Task**: My task was to quickly prepare for the viva despite the short notice and my less-than-ideal preparation. I needed to recall key points related to the topic and compose myself to perform well under pressure. **Action**: Instead of panicking, I decided to utilize the short time available to me wisely. I calmly focused on revising the core aspects of the topic, prioritizing the most critical areas that I thought would be covered in the viva. This involved quickly going through my notes, recalling key concepts, and mentally preparing myself for the kinds of questions that might be asked. **Result**: Despite the initial panic and lack of preparation, I managed to perform well in the viva. I scored 8 out of 10, which was a pleasant surprise given my circumstances. This experience taught me the importance of staying calm under pressure and the value of focused, quick revision.

788,"Background:
I am an individual with experience in the marketing domain (No coding experience). I am looking for different opportunities and I have now started with the process of cold emailing recruiters, clients, and many more people of different occupations in order to connect with them on a personal level and provide them a solution for industry wise, company wise pain points.

Problem:
The task of cold emailing consumes a lot of time. For instance it comprises of the following tasks:
a.	Studying about the industry
b.	Studying about the company that the recipient is working in
c.	Studying about the individual
d.	Finding combined pain points of all above points
e.	Preparation of cold email while including all key aspects of cold-email like time bound, personalized content of email
f.	And more
So, if this task is being done for more than 5 recipients of different industries, companies or backgrounds, it takes a lot of time for someone like me who is already working full time currently.

My Solution:
I found n8n is a platform that can automate all these tasks for me by creating a proper workflow, and all I will be required to do is execute it whenever I want to roll out the personalised, properly researched cold emails.

Elaborated requirements:
I have the following columns in the input Google Sheets, from which data for recipients is to be taken:
a.	First Name
b.	Last Name
c.	Title
d.	Company Name
e.	Email
So, based on the company’s name, research about its background and pain points in the recent market. Then, focus on the pain points and prepare the kind of services I can provide as per my domain to resolve the issues of the corporation. Once the email is ready I want it to be exported in a Google Sheet. 

I want a free of cost approach, so even if any background study is to be conducted I want it to be done via a search engine not any APIs.

797,"Create a presentation on Lab-grown organs
Lab-grown organs, or organoids, are miniature, simplified versions of human organs created in a lab from stem cells. While full-sized, transplantable organs are not yet a reality, organoids mimic the structure and function of their counterparts, allowing researchers to study diseases, test drugs more accurately, and advance personalized medicine. Recent breakthroughs include developing organoids with blood vessels, which makes them more realistic models. 
How lab-grown organs are made
Stem cells: Researchers start with stem cells, which can be embryonic, adult, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient's own cells.
Chemical signals: Stem cells are exposed to specific growth factors and chemical signals that direct them to develop into particular tissue types.
Self-organization: The cells self-organize into three-dimensional structures that resemble human organs, such as mini-brains, lungs, and intestines.
Recent advancements: A major recent advance has been the development of organoids that can grow their own blood vessels, creating more sophisticated and functional models. 
What they are used for
Drug testing and personalized medicine: Organoids provide a more human-specific model for testing the effectiveness and potential risks of drugs, leading to personalized treatments.
Disease modeling: They offer a way to study how diseases, like cancer or neurological disorders, form and progress in a human-like environment.
Fundamental research: They are invaluable tools for developmental biology and for understanding physiological processes in a way that isn't possible with traditional cell cultures or animal models.
Potential future applications: The long-term goal is to grow full-sized, transplantable organs for patients. Some research is focused on building individual components, like heart ventricles, to see if larger structures can eventually be constructed. 
What is currently possible
Researchers can grow organoids of various organs, including the brain, intestine, lung, liver, and heart.
The current size limit for organoids is approximately 1 mm, partly due to nutrient diffusion challenges, but they are sophisticated enough for many research purposes.
Organoid hearts can beat, and organoid kidneys can form urine when implanted in lab animals.","Create a comprehensive presentation on lab-grown organs, also known as organoids, focusing on their development, applications, and potential future advancements.

809,in this page solve only example 19 full step by step with appropriate formula,"To solve Example 19 step by step with appropriate formulas, follow these steps: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: Identify the equation or problem statement given in Example 19. Since the specific details of Example 19 are not provided, we will assume a general approach to solving an equation where the absolute value of x equals 19, i.e., |x| = 19. 2. **Breaking Down the Absolute Value Equation**: - The equation |x| = 19 implies that x can either be 19 or -19 because the absolute value of both 19 and -19 equals 19. - Therefore, we have two possible solutions: x = 19 and x = -19. 3. **Applying the Definition of Absolute Value**: - The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Hence, for |x| = 19, x is 19 units away from zero in either direction. 4. **Considering Other Operations**: - If the problem involves other operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to find a value related to x = 19, we would apply those operations directly. For example, if we need to find x + 19 or 19 * x, we substitute x with 19 or -19 and calculate accordingly. 5. **Graphical Representation (if applicable)**: - If the problem involves finding where the graph of an equation crosses the x-axis (i.e., where y = 0), and it's related to x = 19, we would look for points where x equals 19 or -19, depending on the equation's form. 6. **Solving for x with Given Equations**: - Without a specific equation from Example 19, we'll use a hypothetical equation like x^2 = 19^2 to demonstrate solving for x. - Solving x^2 = 361 gives us x = ±√361, which simplifies to x = ±19. 7. **Rounding Solutions (if necessary)**: - If the problem asks for solutions to be rounded to a certain decimal place, we round our solutions accordingly. For exact solutions like x = 19 or x = -19, no rounding is needed unless the problem specifies otherwise. 8. **Finalizing the Solution**: - After solving the equation step by step, we select the correct choice based on our calculations and fill in any answer boxes as required. Given the lack of specific details about Example 19, the steps above provide a general framework for solving equations involving absolute values or operations that result in x = 19. For a precise solution, the exact problem statement from Example 19 would be necessary.",0.5256,29.57,True,False,False,False,,8.5,accept,"The enhanced prompt provides a clear and step-by-step solution to the problem, including relevant formulas and explanations."

*Problem Context*

Illegal and unmonitored open-crust mining is a critical national challenge, undermining India's economic stability and environmental health. Illicit operations are rampant across numerous states, leading to an annual loss of thousands of crores in unpaid royalties and taxes—funds essential for national development. The environmental toll is equally severe, with unregulated mining causing widespread deforestation, soil degradation, and water pollution.




Current monitoring methods are manual, resource-intensive, and slow. Field surveys are infrequent, expensive, and fail to provide timely or comprehensive data. This reactive approach means authorities often discover violations only after significant resource theft and irreversible ecological harm have occurred. Officials lack the tools to accurately quantify the volume of illegally extracted material, which weakens enforcement and penalty assessment. There is an urgent need to replace this outdated system with an intelligent, scalable solution that aligns with the government's commitment to resource conservation and digital governance. OreNexus directly addresses this gap, providing a precise, automated tool to safeguard national assets.

Problem statement : Netflix and Amazon use responsive design to adapt layout for mobile and desktop.

1. Introduction
Both Netflix and Amazon serve millions of users across devices—from large desktop screens to mobile phones and tablets. Their success depends heavily on providing a consistent and intuitive experience regardless of device type.
Responsive web design allows these platforms to automatically adjust layout, content size, and navigation patterns to fit different screen resolutions and input methods.

2. Key Responsive Design Strategies
Strategy			Netflix		Amazon
Fluid Grid Layouts			Uses flexible grids to resize thumbnails and rows dynamically		Uses fluid grids to adjust product listings and sidebars based on screen width
Media Queries			Adapts poster sizes, margins, and navigation visibility		Adjusts product grid (number of items per row), image resolution, and menu layout
Flexible Images			Scales movie/show posters proportionally without distortion		Optimizes product images for clarity and loading speed across devices
Mobile-First Design			Prioritizes mobile navigation and content hierarchy		Mobile experience prioritized with clear call to action (“Buy Now,” “Add to Cart”)
Progressive Enhancement			Enhances experience with animations and hover effects on larger screens		Adds advanced filtering and sorting on desktops while keeping mobile simple

3. Grid-Based Layout
Netflix:
•	Uses a horizontal scrolling grid for categories (e.g., “Popular on Netflix”, “Trending Now”).
•	The number of items per row changes with screen width (e.g., 6 per row on desktop → 2–3 on mobile).
•	Maintains visual balance using consistent aspect ratios for thumbnails.
Amazon:
•	Employs a vertical product grid that rearranges product cards depending on viewport size.
•	On desktop: multiple columns with side filters.
•	On mobile: single-column layout with collapsible filters.

4. Navigation
Netflix:
•	Desktop: Persistent top navigation bar with categories (Home, TV Shows, Movies).
•	Mobile: Collapsible menu; navigation moves to a single icon for minimal clutter.
•	Prioritizes content discovery with minimal clicks.
Amazon:
•	Desktop: Multi-level mega menu with product categories, departments, and recommendations.
•	Mobile: Simplified hamburger menu; categories shown progressively to avoid overload.
•	Search bar remains central and visible on all devices, reflecting search-driven behavior.

5. Interaction Design
Netflix:
•	On desktop: Hover effects display show descriptions and previews.
•	On mobile: Tap actions replace hover; content expands or overlays the screen.
•	Smooth transitions ensure continuity between devices.

Amazon:
•	On desktop: Hovering reveals product details, options, and quick-view panels.
•	On mobile: Touch-based interactions—users scroll vertically and tap to view details.
•	Uses large touch targets for easy selection on small screens.


6. Product Grid & Filters
Netflix (Content Grid):
•	Uses a dynamic content grid that adjusts based on available screen width.
•	No explicit filters—recommendations and personalized rows act as implicit filters.

Amazon (Product Grid):
•	Desktop: Multi-column grid with filters visible on the left sidebar.
•	Mobile: Filters hidden behind a “Filter” button for simplicity.
•	Filters and sort options are prioritized by relevance (e.g., price, rating, delivery time).

7. User Experience (UX) Benefits
UX Benefit		Explanation
Consistency		Users experience familiar interfaces and controls across devices.
Accessibility		Larger buttons, readable typography, and scalable layouts enhance usability.
Performance		Optimized images and adaptive loading improve site speed and reduce bounce rates.
Engagement		Easy navigation and personalized layouts keep users browsing longer.
Conversion		Streamlined purchase (Amazon) and viewing (Netflix) flows improve conversion rates.

8. Research & Insights
•	User Research Findings:
o	70%+ of Netflix streaming and over 60% of Amazon browsing happen on mobile devices.
o	Users expect fast-loading, adaptive interfaces that require minimal zooming or panning.
o	Responsive designs reduce bounce rates by up to 30% on both platforms.

•	Technical Research:
o	Both platforms rely on frameworks like React and Node.js with responsive CSS using Flexbox and Grid Layout.
o	Employ CDNs and adaptive image loading for performance optimization.


9. Code 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1"">
<style>
nav {display:flex;justify-content:space-between;align-items:center;background:#111;padding:10px;color:#fff;}

<nav><span class=""logo"">NETFLIX</span><div class=""menu""><a>Home</a><a>Movies</a><a>Series</a></div><span class=""menu-icon"">☰</span></nav>
</body>
</html>


 Output explanation:
•	On desktop, you see the full navigation links.
•	On mobile (width < 600px), the menu hides and a hamburger icon (☰) appears a common pattern used by Netflix and Amazon apps.


10. Conclusion
Netflix and Amazon exemplify how responsive design enhances cross-device usability.
Their adaptive grids, flexible navigation, and performance-focused strategies create seamless experiences that balance content visibility, ease of interaction, and conversion efficiency.
Through continuous testing and user-centred design, both platforms demonstrate that responsiveness is not only about resizing layouts—but about adapting experiences to user context and behaviour.

929,"Project Management Code Revision Report

This report details the revision of your project's data tracking codes to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline processes.

1. Identification of Current Codes

The codes currently responsible for ""project tracking"" (managing the user database) are:




detector.py: This file reads known_persons.csv into a DataFrame (KNOWN_PERSONS_DF) when the application first starts.

utils.py: This file handles writing new user registrations to the known_persons.csv file.

Identified Problem (The ""Manual Error""):

The current system has a major flaw. detector.py reads the CSV only once at startup. When app.py calls utils.py to register a new person, the detector class is unaware of this new data. The new person will not be recognized until you manually stop and restart the entire application. This is a critical process inefficiency.

2. Specification of New Requirements

To ""streamline processes"" and ""reduce manual errors"" (i.e., prevent stale data), the new requirements are:




Live Data: The detector must read the most recent user data at the time of recognition.

Atomic & Consistent I/O: The system must use a single, robust library (pandas) for both reading and writing to the database to prevent data corruption.

Concurrency-Safe: The code must prevent ""race conditions"" where one part of the app tries to read the CSV while another is writing to it.

3. Development of New Codes (Revised)

Here are the revised codes that meet these new requirements.







4. Testing and Validation

The new codes are now ""fully compatible with our existing project management system"" and resolve the primary inefficiency.

Example Use Case (Validation Test):




Start the System: Run python app.py.

Verify (Pre-Test): Have an existing registered person (e.g., ""Venky"") stand in front of the camera. The system will recognize ""Venky"".

Register New ""Task"": The app will ask, ""Do you want to register a new person?"" Type y.

Enter Name: NewPerson

Enter User ID: 12345

... (etc.)

The system will capture your image and utils.py will update the CSV.

Validate (Post-Test): Without restarting the application, have ""NewPerson"" stand in front of the camera.

Old System (Failure): The system would show ""Unknown"".

New Revised System (Success): detector.py will run, find a match, and then read the fresh known_persons.csv file. It will find ""NewPerson"" and correctly display NewPerson (ID:12345 Role:...).

Success Criteria Confirmation

Meets all requirements: Yes. The system now uses live data.

Fully compatible: Yes. We only modified the internals of detector.py and utils.py without changing how app.py interacts with them.

Improve efficiency and effectiveness: Yes. The ""manual error"" of needing to restart the application to recognize new users is eliminated, dramatically streamlining the process.

Well-documented: Yes. The code is commented with REVISION blocks. can u change codes for the each and every file tht face recoginze and facial expression ","**Project Management Code Revision Report: Face Recognition and Facial Expression Analysis** ### Introduction The goal of this project is to revise the existing face recognition and facial expression analysis codes to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline processes.

If so, create a new user account and associate it with the referrer's user ID. 4. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where the referrer's user ID is not found in the database or the invitation identifier is invalid. **Database Schema:** * **Users Table**: Store user information with a unique user ID, email address, and other relevant details. * **Referrals Table**: Store referral information with foreign keys to the Users table, including the referrer's user ID, invitee's email address (if applicable), and invitation status. **Implementation Steps:** 1. Create a new route for generating referral links, which will return a unique link containing the referrer's user ID and invitation identifier. 2. Create a new route for handling referral link redirection, which will redirect the user to the registration page with the referrer's user ID and invitation identifier as query parameters. 3.
